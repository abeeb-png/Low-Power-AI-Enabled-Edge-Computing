# Low-Power, AI Enabled Edge Computing
## Abstract
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized Machine Learning and AI applications, particularly in scenarios with locally accessible data, devices, and networks. However, edge computing presents unique challenges, requiring the use of resource-constrained devices like Microcontroller Units (MCUs) and sensors connected to external, often remote, networks. These limitations necessitate innovative strategies to enable the deployment of AI at the edge. This project aims to make AI and Machine Learning algorithms more accessible for edge computing environments by improving efficiency and automation in task execution. We focus on two key methodologies: (1) pruning and quantization of neural networks, and (2) spiking neural networks (SNNs). Additionally, the proposed solutions are applied to an environmental control scenario, utilizing an IoT framework in conjunction with AIenabled devices. The overarching goal of this work is to democratize AI for edge computing by leveraging efficient and innovative techniques that maintain competitive accuracy while addressing the constraints of edge devices.
